A LIRI Node App

There are four things that you can do in this app from command line:

1) my-tweets:
    This calls the last 20 tweets from my personal twitter account from the oldest to the most recent.  If there are less than 20 tweets, it lists what's there.

2) spotify-this-song:
    This takes an argument of a song title and lists out the artist, song name, a link to a clip of the song, and the album the song is from.  No quotations are needed around the title of song title argument.

3) movie-this:
    This takes an argument of a movie title and lists out the movie title, year it came out, IMDB rating, rotten tomatoes rating, country produced, language of the movie, movie plot, and movie actors.  No quotations are needed around the title of song title argument.

4) do-what-it-says:
    This calls the spotify-this-song function but uses a pre-existing text as the argument for the song title.

If none of the four functions are called, then and invalid statment is made.
